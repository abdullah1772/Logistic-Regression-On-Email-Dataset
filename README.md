**Binary Logistic Regression on Email Data**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of binary logistic regression on email data. By using logistic regression, we can classify emails into different categories based on their features and gain valuable insights.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of emails, with each email labeled as either spam or not spam (ham). The dataset has been preprocessed and is ready to be used for analysis.

**Notebook Overview**
In the notebook, we walk through the entire process of applying binary logistic regression to the email data. Here's an overview of the key sections covered:

**Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
We start by loading the dataset and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as cleaning the text, tokenization, and feature engineering.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
Next, we conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. We visualize the distribution of spam and ham emails, analyze the most frequent words, and explore the relationship between different features and the target variable.

**Model Development:**
In this section, we dive into the logistic regression model. We explain the intuition behind logistic regression, its mathematical formulation, and the underlying assumptions. Then, we split the data into training and testing sets and train the logistic regression model on the training data.

**Model Evaluation:**
After training the model, we evaluate its performance using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
